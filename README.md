# Wage by Age Group Mixed Model

The research question addressed in this study is focused on the wages of early childhood teachers, and how the age group of the children they work with may impact their wage.

The dataset for this project was collected through the Early Childhood Project Registry. This was part of a methods of data analysis project for Montana State University in Spring 2019, and was used to help inform the Early Childhood Project about workforce wages.
